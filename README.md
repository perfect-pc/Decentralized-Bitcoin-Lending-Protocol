# BitFi - Decentralized Bitcoin Lending Protocol

BitFi is an innovative DeFi protocol built on the Stacks blockchain that enables users to use their Stacked STX as collateral for borrowing, creating a unique financial primitive that turns staked assets into productive capital.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Novel Collateralization with Stacked STX
- **Productive Staking**: Use your Stacked STX tokens as collateral while continuing to earn stacking rewards
- **Capital Efficiency**: Unlock liquidity from your staked assets without unstaking
- **Bitcoin-Native**: Built specifically for the Stacks/Bitcoin ecosystem

### Core Functionality
- **Vault System**: Create isolated collateral vaults with your STX
- **Flexible Borrowing**: Borrow against your collateral with competitive rates
- **Dynamic Interest Rates**: Algorithmically determined rates based on pool utilization
- **Automated Liquidations**: Robust liquidation engine to maintain protocol solvency

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The protocol consists of three main smart contracts:

### 1. Stacking Collateral Contract (`stacking-collateral.clar`)
- Manages user vaults and collateral positions
- Handles deposits, withdrawals, borrowing, and repayments
- Implements safety checks and collateralization ratios
- Tracks stacking rewards and cycles

### 2. Lending Pool Contract (`lending-pool.clar`)
- Manages the lending pool liquidity
- Calculates dynamic interest rates based on utilization
- Handles supply and borrow rate calculations
- Manages reserve factors and protocol fees

### 3. Liquidation Engine Contract (`liquidation-engine.clar`)
- Monitors vault health and collateralization ratios
- Executes liquidations for undercollateralized positions
- Applies liquidation penalties to maintain protocol stability

## üìä Key Parameters

- **Minimum Collateralization Ratio**: 150%
- **Base Interest Rate**: 5% APY
- **Optimal Utilization Rate**: 80%
- **Maximum Interest Rate**: 25% APY
- **Liquidation Penalty**: 10%
- **Reserve Factor**: 10%
